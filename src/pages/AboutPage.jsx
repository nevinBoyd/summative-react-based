      <h2>About Get Baked</h2>
      <p>
        Born from the SoCal surf and skate scene, <strong>Get Baked</strong> is
        where pastry meets punk. We serve savory and sweet pies, cookies, and
        coffee — baked daily with love and a little rebellion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our shop doubles as a creative hub — we feature local artists, host
        pop-ups, and take in <strong>comic book donations</strong> to pass on to
        the next generation of dreamers.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: "#ff66cc", fontStyle: "italic", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        “Skate on down, bring some comics, hang a piece, and stay for a slice.”
